\title{Dichotomize p-value matrix to 0-1 matrix for each PW across datasets��output metaP and metaFDR as well.}
\usage{
dichotGSAR(input2PWcTalk, pTh.dataset = 0.01)
}
\arguments{
\item{input2PWcTalk}{File name of the CSV output file from prior metaGSAR analysis. This file includes k p-values for each pathway represented in rows (k: number of repetitive datasets). Several columns of meta-P values follow the dataset-specific p-value columns.}

\item{pTh.dataset}{cutoff value to dichotomize the continuous p-value from preceding MetaGSCA analysis. Low/significant p's are converted to 1's.}
