\title{Calculate similarity measure for every pair of PWs}
\usage{
PWsim(dichotP, test = c("phi", "binary")[1])
}
\arguments{
\item{dichotP}{MetaGSAR p-value matrix for n PWs across k datasets.}

\item{test}{Choice of similarity measure over two binary vectors. For binary, it uses 1-dist(...,method='binary')}
}
\value{
A data frame for all possible pathway paris [n*(n-1)/2]. 1st & 2nd cols: the two vertices comprising an edge. 3rd col: edge connection strength. It is full connection still.
