Description: MetaGSCA systematically assesses the coexpression disturbance of a gene set by pooling the results from individual studies. A nonparametric approach named GSNCA (Rahmatallah 2014, Bioinformatics) is used to test whether the gene set is differentially co-expresssed between the two conditions, and a permutation test p-value is computed. Bootstrap-ping is used to construct confidence intervals of p-values. Meta-analysis is offered through two options: random-intercept logistic regression model and the inverse variance method. Lastly, a pathway crosstalk network is delineated based on the meta-analysis result outputted from the prior steps.
